This mini project was started because i wanted to find a
way to host the messaging queue service via a web service.

A few considerations was necessary to decide how we wanted to do this
1. The messaging service was to support AQMP a.k.a Advanced Message Queuing Protocol
2. It should be able to support the usual HTTP protocol
3. Ideally, it should be RESTful (not implemented yet, soon)

After discussing with my colleague, Liu Xiao Hui
aka as Oreh Linden (ahh the good ol'days in Linden Lab) we
decided that i should build one instead using CherryPy and
Pika.

What we have 
-------------------
1. Create named Queues
2. Send messages to named or default queues
3. Create exchanges
4. Send messages to named or default exchanges
